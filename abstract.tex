  We establish the uniqueness of the positive, radially  symmetric solution to
  the differential equation $\Delta u - u + u^p = 0$ (with $p>1$) in a bounded or
  unbounded annular region in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for all $n\geq 1$, with the Neumann
  boundary condition on the inner ball and the Dirichlet boundary condition on the outer ball
  (to be interpreted as decaying to zero in the case of an unbounded region).
  The regions we are interested in include, in particular, the cases of a ball,
  the exterior of a ball, and the whole space.
  For $p=3$ and $n=3$, this is a well-known result of \textsc{Coffman}, which was latter
  extended by \textsc{McLeod} \& \textsc{Serrin} to general $n$ and all values of $p$
  below a certain bound depending on $n$.
  Our result shows that such a bound on $p$ is not needed.
  The basic approach used in this work is that of \textsc{Coffman},
  but several of the principal steps in the proof are carried out with the help
  of Sturm's oscillation theory for linear second-order differential equations.
  Elementary topological arguments are widely used in the study.
